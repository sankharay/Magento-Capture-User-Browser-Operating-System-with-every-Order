For more info :

Every company think in magento thereâ€™s lack of tracking in orders. so i built this extension which admin to see orders source & who order this from customer care.
How this works :
1. with the help of this extension we are storing User Browser, User Operating system with every order which help marketing and other departments to generate reports very easially and effectily.
2. if you have more then 5 people customer service team its very difficult to find who generate this order. because customer care receive call & lots of time customer service generate / create orders from backend. so this module help admin to store admin user names with every email. which later help to find who in customer service team generate which order and all details visible on backend under order details.
NOTE : this extension work with Update Guest Order email address. so please download update guest order extension and install first then install this extension. and make sure you need to create three columns under sales_flat_order table ( under magento database )
first create these columns under sales_flat_order module then install this module.
